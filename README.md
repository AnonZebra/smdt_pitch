# smdt_pitch.psyexp
This is a PsychoPy experiment based on the "Pitch" subtest of the [Swedish Musical Discrimination Test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000841)(SMDT), as described in the linked article. The SMDT was developed at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Neuroscience by a research group led by Fredrik Ullén, and any use of the test should be discussed with them.

The developer (Lowe Wilsson) claims no authorship/copyright over the SMDT, as the SMDT is Fredrik Ullén & colleagues' work and property. Please do not use this project, other than for testing it yourself, without contacting me and/or the research group at Karolinska Institutet.
